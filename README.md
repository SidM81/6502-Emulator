# Rust 6502 Emulator

## Overview
This project is a 6502 microprocessor emulator implemented in Rust. The 6502 microprocessor was a widely used CPU in early personal computers and gaming consoles. This emulator aims to faithfully replicate the behavior of the original hardware, allowing users to run vintage software and explore retro computing environments.

## Features
- **Accurate Emulation:** The emulator provides accurate emulation of the 6502 microprocessor, ensuring compatibility with original software and games.
- **Optimized Performance:** Leveraging Rust's efficiency and low-level control, the emulator achieves high performance even on modern hardware.
- **Modular Design:** The codebase is structured in a modular fashion, making it easy to understand and extend for future enhancements or optimizations.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed documentation is provided to guide users in understanding the emulator's internals, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers.
- **Continuous Integration:** Integrated continuous integration (CI) pipelines automate testing to ensure ongoing reliability of the emulator.

## Usage
To use the emulator, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Build the emulator using `cargo build`.
4. Run the emulator with your desired ROM file using `cargo run -- <path_to_rom>`.

## Contributing
